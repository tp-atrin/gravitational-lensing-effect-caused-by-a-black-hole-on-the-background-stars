# Gravitational Lensing Simulator
This python script simulates the gravitational lensing effect caused by a black hole on the background stars

# Installation
To run this script, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:
'''
pip install numpy matplotlib
'''

# Usage
To run the simulation, simply execute the lensing_simulator.py file using Python:
'''
python lensing_simulator.py
'''
This will generate an image of the lensed star field in the current directory.

# Configuration
You can configure the simulation by changing the values of the parameters at the top of the lensing_simulator.py file. These include the mass and distance of the black hole, the size and resolution of the image, and the number of background stars to simulate.
